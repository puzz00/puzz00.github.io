        <h2>WinRM</h2>
        <p>
            This is the Windows Remote Management Protocol and it lets people execute commands on a windows box remotely via the internet or an internal network. Windows Remote Management is often used by system administrators to manage hosts on a network remotely. They can use valid credentials and then interact with the remote machines which have winrm enabled - it is not enabled by default. This service runs on port 5985 with http or 5986 with https.
        </p>
        <h2>Credentials</h2>
        <p>
            We need valid credentials so a brute force attack using crackmapexec is a good start point. We can narrow down our search to users we have enumerated or the default windows accounts such as administrator: <code>sudo crackmapexed winrm 10.2.18.45 -u administrator -p rockyou.txt</code> If we have found valid credentials for other services such as smb or rdp, it is worth trying them with rdp just in case the user has reused their password.
        </p>
        <h2>Exploitation</h2>
        <p>
            Once we have found valid credentials, we can run commands using the winrm service through crackmapexec: <code>sudo crackmapexec winrm 10.2.18.45 -u administrator -p tinkerbell -x "systeminfo"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            We can get a shell using: <code>sudo evil-winrm.rb -u administrator -p tinkerbell -i 10.2.18.45</code> or <code>use exploit/windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec</code> (this one uses msfconsole - we need to set the usual options but also set FORCE_VBS true).
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            WinRM is another native service on windows which provides us with a vector to attack if we find it is up and running.
